	<h3>MAKE A LIST</h3>
<p class="article">The second most important thing after this decision is to write down a personal list of reasons why you want to preserve your virginity till your wedding date. Make this list comprehensive enough. Include every reason you can think of under heaven. </p>
<p class="article">Some of the reasons may look insignificant and others selfish. Those do not matter for now. What matters is that you have a written list of reasons why you have personally desired to keep your virginity till you are married, either reasonable or not!</p>
<p class="article">If you cannot think of a sufficient number of reasons, you can flip through the last two chapters of this book again. It may open your eyes to some of the reasons which you have not thought about. Once you are done compiling this list, and you are okay with whatever you have listed, make three copies of the list. </p>
<p class="article">Keep another copy where you keep your most valuable documents. This could be in a separate file hidden somewhere in a safe place in your wardrobe or drawer. Wherever you keep it, make sure it will not get lost in a long time. This will serve as the Master Copy from where you make more duplicates in case something happens to the other two copies.</p>
<p class="article">If your parents believe in and encourage you to keep your virginity (some parents do not encourage their children to), keep the second copy of the list with them. Let them know your decision about the issue at hand and ask that you will appreciate their assistance in every way possible to make this dream a reality. You will be sure that your parents will be too delighted to know your decision. This singular action will earn you some respect from them, and they will make sure that they help you to fulfill your decision. They may begin to watch some of your moves more closely and scrutinize some of the people you call your friends. It is all a way of making sure that you do not go back on this decision.</p>
<p class="article">Paste the last one, as a constant reminder, where you will see it regularly. It may be pasted on the wall beside your bed, in front of your wardrobe, beside your dressing table or just somewhere you will always see it.</p>
<p class="article">This will, from time to time, help you to renew your commitment to yourself each time you see it. It will also help you to reaffirm your belief in virginity in times of personal doubts, peer pressures, sexual challenges and temptation. </p>
<p class="article">More importantly, constantly reading this will build in you a strong will to say no whenever you need to </p>
