	<h3>TALK TO YOUR PARENTS</h3>
<p class="article">If you are still a virgin and you are undergoing serious pressures about your virginity, the best person to confide in is your parent. Your parent should be your first confidant. </p>
<p class="article">If you are lucky enough to live with your parents, you can be sure that, since they have known you all of your life and have, likely experienced the pressure you may be undergoing now, they are most likely going to give you the best advice you can get at a time like this. </p>
<p class="article">It is possible to begin to think that you are already mature to take decisions about your life since you feel you are older than you really are and your parents are not allowing you to exercise the freedom that you think you need. The actual truth is, whatever decision your parents take about your sexual life, is for your own good. They are only trying to protect you from the sexual preys around.  </p>
<p class="article">You may be tempted to think that they are of the outgoing generation, generally called the ‘old school’, and may not have the ‘new school’ solutions, but the truth is that there is nothing new about sexual pressures. It has always been there from time, and they have had their own challenges too, coupled with the experiences they have garnered around from friends, neighbors, and relatives, they will be able to proffer an all-time solution to whatever peer pressure and sexual challenge you may be facing in this new generation. </p>
<p class="article">So, always learn to confide in your parents. Talk to them about your emotions and feelings, your friends, their behaviors, your experiences, and share the challenges you face with them. </p>
<p class="article">The alternative will be to talk to your friends about it. However, you may not be too sure of their stand, no matter how close you are to them, or how well you think you know them. </p>
<p class="article">Your parents are the only ones you can talk to and be sure they will not ridicule, mock, or deceive you. You can be sure of constant good counsel. They will even love you more, knowing that you really desire to live a pure and chaste life, and will do all in their power to see you achieve your goal.</p>
<p class="article">If you do not live with your parents, you can talk to either your guardians or your pastors in church.</p>
