	<h3>DANGERS OF PREMARITAL SEX</h3>
						<p>Having discussed reasons which teenagers and young adults always give or receive in order to engage in premarital sex, in this chapter, we will look at reasons why you should not engage in it. </p>

<h3 class="heading-section">SEX REDUCES YOU TO A TOY</h3>
<p  class="article">Those who beg to see what lies in between your thighs will not tell you this: Sex reduces you to a sex object. Once you taste your first sexual experience, the desire to have a repeat performance of the same from time to time is automatically activated. This stimulated sexual appetite makes you vulnerable to every proposal from members of the opposite sex. The more you get, the more you are likely to desire until you begin to sleep around with everyone that cares to. </p>
<p class="article">This desire in itself is neither ungodly nor demonic. It was created by God, but with a condition; it is only allowed within the boundary of marriage. Such that if your first sexual encounter is on your wedding night, each time the desire rises, your spouse is always beside you to share your affection. If you decide to have a taste of this experience before marriage, be you a young man or woman, you put yourself in a difficult situation where you become ‘cheap meat’ in the hands of any good looking person that comes around you, as long as they can speak a few enticing words that will arouse your emotion.</p>
<p class="article">Sex is not just the act of using the other person for self-gratification: This is what early sex reduces you to! It turns your body into an amusement park where anyone and everyone can catch fun at will. You become a playground where everyone goes to in order to catch some fun whenever they need to relax.</p>
<p class="article">This is why God designed it that your first experience will be within the confinement of marriage, so that once the sexual desire is triggered, you have a partner beside you who has legal approval to satisfy your appetite.</p>
<p class="article">Do not reduce yourself to a sex toy; it is a dangerous thing to be. Preserve your self.</p>
