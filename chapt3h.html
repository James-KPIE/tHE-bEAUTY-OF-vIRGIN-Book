	<h3>GIVES YOU A STABLE MARRIAGE</h3>
						<p class="article">Most people have ignorantly argued that losing your virginity before marriage practically has nothing to do with the divorce rate in marriages. However, this has been proven wrong of late. </p>
						<p class="article">A research was recently conducted by Family Medical Issues Analyst, Reginald Finger, of Colorado Springs. The study, "Association of Virginity at Age 18 With Educational, Economic, Social, and Health Outcomes in Middle Adulthood," examined the outcomes of men and women who remain virgins until they are 18 and above and was published in Adolescent and Family Health, vol. 3, no. 4.</p>
						<p class="article">“It is very much as we suspected - that adolescent virginity has a significant impact on well-being in middle adulthood,” Finger said. “We found that men and women who were virgins at age 18, when evaluated approximately 20 years later, had about half the risk of divorce, had completed about an additional year of education and had annual incomes nearly 20 percent higher than those who were not virgins at 18. We used 18 as the cut off age because it gave approximately equal populations of virgins and non-virgins to study”. </p>
						<p class="article">This study was conducted by examining the results from 3,750 men and 3,620 women.  Finger continued “We found, as well, that these better outcomes were not merely the result of avoiding teenage pregnancy or fatherhood. The outcomes are inherent to remaining abstinent.”</p>
						<p class="article">“In addition, we found that female virgins were more likely than their non-virgin counterparts to have a positive financial net worth and were almost half as likely as non-virgins to use welfare benefits.” Finger said.</p>
						<p class="article">The final conclusion of the research: “The unmistakable message of this study is that abstinence is the best course for our children and teens. Focus on the Family constantly encourages abstinence until marriage as the best choice - the one that is likely to lead to healthy outcomes in several significant measures of well-being. Abstinence is more than just avoiding STDs and teenage pregnancy - as the condom- based curricula seek. Abstinence is, without a doubt, the only choice to give our next generation the best chance in life.”</p>
						<p class="article">Now, you are sure that keeping your virginity till marriage will help stabilize your marriage against the storm of divorce. From the research above, young adults who kept their virginity until marriage when evaluated 20 years later were discovered to have been able to overcome half the risk of divorce. </p>
						<p class="article">So if you want a stable marriage later in life, be you a young man or young woman, you start building the foundation today by appreciating and safeguarding your virginity until your wedding day. It has a way of saving you from divorce. </p>
