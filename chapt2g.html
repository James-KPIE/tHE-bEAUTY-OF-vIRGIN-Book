	<h3>ABORTION</h3>
<p class="article">A common way of escape for those who finds themselves in this birdcage of unwanted pregnancy is abortion. The first advice your mates will give you is to abort it before anyone gets to know about it. They will even tell you not to let your parents hear a word about it. They will encourage you to keep it as secret as possible until the abortion plan is perfected and hatched, so as to cover up the public shame.</p>
<p class="article">This advice may come from a ‘so-called’ sincere heart that shows love and concern for you, but it is not the best for you. Whoever gives you such advice has refused to put into consideration the fact that the process of abortion can tamper with your vital reproductive organs and this can cause you to be barren for life. It can even lead to an untimely death. Uncountable stories abound of ladies who have done abortion and bled to death. This may be due to medical mismanagement or personal carelessness.</p>
<p class="article">This is because you are still young and your organs are still tender and soft, therefore, complications can arise if not well handled by an experienced personnel, who is trusted by your parents, and who is authorized by the government. This is why you must make sure you carry your parents along if you mistakenly fall into this error. However, it is better not to fall into it, than to start crying after the milk is spilled. Prevention is better, and safer, than cure.</p>
<p class="article">Lastly, you need to know that abortion is a grievous sin before God. Even if you succeed with the abortion without any complications, you would have succeeded in committing the sin of murder of an unborn child, in addition to the sin on ground – fornication.</p>
