	<h3>AVOID SECLUDED PLACES</h3>
<p class="article">Be careful if you have made a choice to remain a virgin. Watch where you go with members of the opposite sex. The strength of immorality is isolation. No one will remove your pants and sleep with you in the public glare of your classmates. Even if you meet a porn star who is willing to do it publicly shamelessly, your self-respect and dignity will not make you allow someone to mess around with you openly as though you are a cheap whore. However, the courage to do it becomes stronger and your self-guard is lowered if there are just the two of you in a secluded place.</p>
<p class="article">If at all you must attend any night party, go with the permission of your parents or your guardian. Do not hide such things from them. No matter how old you are, as long as you are not married, the people you live with must know your whereabouts each time. If you are a lady, do not go alone. Go in the company of close friends who have the same values with you and do not lose track of one another at the party. Always move together, so you can watch one another’s backs.</p>
<p class="article">Besides not going to parties alone, as much as possible, do not be found with members of the opposite sex in lonely places like the bedroom of an empty house, the hostel room when none else is around in the hostel, an uncompleted building, large lonely field, car parked in a secluded area, or any isolated environment.</p>
<p class="article">Any slight emotional exchange in places like these can spark off an uncontrollable outburst of emotions that may make you lose your guard and do the unthinkable. And since there is no one around to stop you, the deed would have been done before you realized it.</p>
<p class="article">Avoid being alone with members of the opposite sex in an environment that may be sexually tempting. Each time you find yourself in such an environment, no matter how much you trust such a person, take your leave. You really do not need the other person’s permission before you go. Just excuse yourself and leave the environment. If you think you need the other person’s permission, then you have lost the battle already.</p>
<p class="article">The longer you stay in such environment an the more difficult it is for you to reason straight, and the more you lose your guard. Your passions will begin to envelope your intellect and your sense of justice and you may begin to condone certain actions from the other person which you naturally will not accommodate. This is a very difficult situation to put yourself in.</p>
<p class="article">Avoid all intimate moments. Do not put yourself in tight corners like this. Always excuse yourself, or better still, tell your partner you will prefer to move into an open space where there are other people, and leave immediately before you will be convinced to do otherwise. Remember, you do not need his permission; you have been fair enough letting him know your decision.</p>
<p class="article">Do not bother about the person’s feelings, at least not now. What matters now is your safety. His feelings can be addressed later on, as long as you are safe.</p>
