	<h3>THERE IS NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT VIRGINITY</h3>
						<p class="article">This is also another lie that is being spread by those who have lost theirs so that others who are still keeping theirs can lose it cheaply. Do not buy their lies. </p>
						<p class="article">Why is so much noise being made about it if there is nothing special about keeping your virginity?  Have you ever given this a thought?  The kind of attention it generates each time it is being discussed, the kind of contribution people make to support their claims and puncture  the arguments of others, the passion with which all concerned defend their stands and try to win other people to their side, all of these show that there is something really special about it. If there is really nothing special about it, why is everybody this concerned? </p>
						<p class="article">You will be surprised to discover that those who reduce its importance are those who lost theirs before time. They have become so used, overused, abused, and misused that they no longer appreciate its speciality. Those who gave theirs to the right persons at the right time will advice that you wait, not just for the right person alone, but also for the right moment. </p>
						<p class="article">If there is nothing special about it, then let those who are canvassing that others lose theirs keep their opinion to themselves. Below are some specialities about virginity: </p>
						<ol>
						<li>The most sexually active organs are hidden in the most private parts of the body, jealously guarded and kept by the Master designer of the body structure.</li>
						<li>For the females, it also comes with a Warranty Seal. Like all brand new packages, imagine written in small invisible letters on it, “warranty void if seal is broken”. This Warranty Seal is called The Hymen. No wonder, in some places, traditionally, once it is broken before the wedding night, the dowry is returned to the groom’s family.</li>
						<li>No one likes to eat other people’s left over. No one likes to marry one who has been promiscuous. Given a choice, every sensible young lad will desire to marry a decent young lady, just like every sensible young lady will desire to marry a decent young lad.</li>
						<li>Losing your virginity is a one-time experience and its best shared with one who will appreciate it for life.</li>
						<li>It is the only wedding gift you can give to your spouse on your wedding night that no other can give to him/her on that special occasion.</li>
						</ol>
						<p class="article">There are so many special things about virginity that time and space will not accommodate in just one book. </p>
						<p class="article">When next someone tells you there is nothing special about being a virgin, rather than let those words get at you and make you withdraw into your shell like a snail threatened by the presence of a snake, be bold enough to look at the person eyeball to eyeball and say, “please keep your opinion to yourself, I am not interested in what you think about my state.”  </p>
						<p class="article">If you can summon enough courage to say this to two or more friends who are pop nosing into your life to ensure you become like they are, they will learn to keep away from you, and this will build your confidence the more. </p>
