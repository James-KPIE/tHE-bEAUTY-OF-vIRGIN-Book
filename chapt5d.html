	<h3>AVOID TROUBLE SPOT</h3>
						<p class="article">There may be some places where you used to go that you can no longer go. This is one of the difficult sacrifices you will need to make. These places are trouble spots; going there means you are looking for trouble.</p>
						<p class="article">You know where these trouble spots are. These are places where you used to go in the past to catch sexual fun. It could be a friend’s room, a hotel, a club or a sugar daddy’s office. Anywhere you know that if you go, you would make yourself vulnerable to such attacks because of the experiences you had previously there, can be called a trouble spot for you.</p>
						<p class="article">If you must stand by your decision to start a new life of purity, you must avoid such places. Temptations from such places are not always easy to overcome. This is because you are already used to the place. Your brain can easily recognize the place and instantly identify it as a place of sexual pleasure because of your past experience, and psychologically, your system is highly expectant of a repeat of the sexual experiences it had there before. </p>
						<p class="article">This, in a way, lowers your guard, such that even if a slight rape attempt is made at you, the inner strength to fight it is weakened, and you find yourself succumbing, easily. If you succumb once, you will succumb again, and again, and again, until you are fully back there.</p>
						<p class="article">Do not put yourself in a situation where you will be tempted to make hasty decisions that you will later regret in life. So, identify where these trouble spots are, and avoid them like a plague.</p>
