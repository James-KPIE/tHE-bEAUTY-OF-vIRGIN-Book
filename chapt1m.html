	<h3>IT IS NOT AS PAINFUL AS THEY SAY IT IS</h3>
						<p class="article">Your devourer, the one who intends to steal your virginity, may promise you that it wonâ€™t hurt you. He may claim to be so good at it that he could handle you in such a way that your first experience will be painless and enjoyable. This may be true, and it may also not be true, depending on your physiological composition. Ladies may experience some pains in their first episode while the guys may feel no physical discomfort. </p>   
						<p class="article">However, the issue is not whether or not it hurts but whether or not it is right. This statement is meant to distract you from the main issue, which is the rightness of the action in question. The question is not about the level of pain you will feel once the action is in progress, but it is about whether you should engage in the action or not in the first place. </p>
						<p class="article">Most people who claim it does not hurt think of the physical pain alone. They are always quick to assume that since sex is a physical action, the extent of damage can only be quantified in the physical. But sex goes beyond the physical into the emotions and, somehow, affects the spiritual. The physical pain may look insignificant, but the emotional pain is much greater. </p>
						<p class="article">The duration of this pain is also of significant note. The physical pain is instant and heals in a few days, but the emotional pain hardly gets healed for life. </p>
						<p class="article">Space here will not be limited to mention the pains. Some of these pains are discussed extensively in the following chapter. </p>
						<p class="article">The truth is, for a girl/lady, the first experience is usually painful; whether you do it now or later. The best is to do it under the confinements of marriage where your partner can cherish the pain. You will even find it pleasurable to experience the pain for and with your husband. You cannot imagine how wonderful it is, </p>
