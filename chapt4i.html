	<h3>IGNORE MOCKERIES</h3>
<p class="article">Your decision to stay chaste and live a moral life will generate so many criticisms among your peers who do not support your reasoning. This resolution will offend their conscience and make them feel bad about themselves and their style of life. However, rather than join you in your decision, since they are in the majority, they will try to make you feel bad in order to cover up how bad you make them feel. So, there is great likelihood that they will call you names, make jest and mockery of you, and do all manner of things just to get at you.</p>
<p class="article">There is not much wisdom in trying to defend yourself. Nothing you say will make them stop taunting you; they did not start it with an intention to stop when you attack them. So, whatever you say in defense will generate more criticism. </p>
<p class="article">The best way to handle them is to ignore them. You just stay strong with your belief and stick to it no matter what anyone says, does, or believes. Since their primary purpose was not just to make you feel bad but to cover up how bad they feel themselves, saying anything to defend yourself will make them feel worse and they will keep getting back at you in order to keep covering up how they feel.</p>
<p class="article">So, if anyone laughs or makes fun of you, just turn your back and ignore them. With time, they also will ignore you and let you be. It makes them feel better that you do not think they are wayward, or that even if you think so, you do not say it to their faces since you are neither their parent nor their spiritual head. They feel that it is left for their pastors to preach that to them, and not you! </p>
<p class="article">The choice of retaining your virginity until the appointed time is a personal decision. Once you have taken this decision after careful thought, let nothing under heaven cause you to waver in this laudable decision. Let no son or daughter of the devil talk you out of it. </p>
<p class="article">Accept how they feel about it and go on with your life. It is better for you as long as it makes you retain your virginity.</p>
