	<h3>RESPECT YOUR BODY</h3>
<p class="article">Your body is your body; it belongs to you and none other. You have a full right, one hundred percent right (100%) over it. You decide whatever happens to it. You also enjoy or suffer whatever happens to it as a result of the decisions made about it. This is why you must constantly protect it. You owe it that responsibility.</p>
<p class="article">The way you jealously protect the call credit and the information on your cell phone and do not just give it to everyone around to make free calls or play around with, same way you should respect and protect your body. No sane person shares his toothbrush with just any friend. Your body is much more valuable than either your toothbrush or the call credit and the information on your cell phone and so should be given more respect and better protection. If you respect your body, others will respect you. If you handle your body loosely with disrespect, others will handle it the same way.</p>
<p class="article">Let no one touch parts of your body anyhow, as though it belongs to them, or as though they have as much right to it as you do. It is fully yours. Even if you decide to go into an intimate relationship with a member of the opposite sex, he still does not have a right over your body until your wedding night when all requirements (by the church, the society and your parents) have been satisfied. </p>
<p class="article">You dictate the rules of the game here, not the other party. You make your own choices about how intimate you want to become with the other party. Whoever is not ready to play the game by the rules you set should find another playmate.</p>
<p class="article">Being in a relationship is not an excuse for sexual experimentation. Let your partner know this afore hand so that it will not become an issue when he begins to make demands of you. Having a special friend from members of the opposite sex is not for the sole purpose of indiscreet exploration of each otherâ€™s bodies but for intimate friendship and companionship. </p>
<p class="article">Constantly remind your partner that as much as you love him, you have reserved yourself as a special package for your wedding night to be presented to the one who is ready to wait till then. Also let him know that placing any form of sexual demands on you before then may cause the breakage of the relationship, and let him know you mean this. Then, sincerely mean it; no other further explanation is necessary. </p>
