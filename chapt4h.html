	<h3>DO NOT START WHAT YOU CAN NOT FINISH</h3>
<p class="article">Do not start what you cannot finish. Every action has an end point. Once the process is initiated, it, most times, becomes practically impossible to halt the natural rate of reaction until the equation is balanced. So, it makes much sense not to try to start the process if you do not want the end result. </p>
<p class="article">It is unreasonable to think that you can succeed in stopping the reaction midway at any particular time you want. It is better not to start it at all, than to hope you will have enough emotional strength to control the reaction in your favour. Do not tempt yourself.</p>
<p class="article">Once in a while, especially when it is necessary, a hug or strolling hand in hand with a loved one may not be out of place, when done in the open and not in isolated places where emotions can over-burn and none will be there to caution you. However, getting too intimate and allowing passions to burn uncontrollably can start a reversible reaction that neither of the parties may not be able to stop, no matter how emotionally strong they feel they are, and the unexpected may happen before they know it.</p>
<p class="article">If preserving your virginity is important to you, then do not get too close for comfort. A gentle kiss may look harmless, but it may ignite some lustful cravings in your body system which may cause you to let down your guard, and freeze your ability to reason properly, until something nasty happens.</p>
<p class="article">Never put yourself in a tight corner, it is very risky. Your knowledge of the risks involved alone may not protect you against them if you put yourself in a tight corner.</p>
