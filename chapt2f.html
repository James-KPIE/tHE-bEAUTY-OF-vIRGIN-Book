<h3>PREGNANCY</h3>
<p class="article">One very major problem of premarital sex is unwanted pregnancy. It is termed unwanted because it will come at a time when you really do not want or need it. You may think you are so smart in your ways or that you know every possible means to guard against it pregnancy. However, things can turn in the direction you are not expecting, and you just find out that, in your early age, you are already pregnant if you are a female, or that you have impregnated a girl if you are a male.</p>
<p class="article">This can make you a laughing stock in your school, neighborhood and your immediate community. It can bring shame and disgrace to both you and your immediate family. You just imagine how your mother would feel to hear the news about this pregnancy, or how your father will react to it. You can be sure it will not be a thing to jubilate over in the family, especially at this time that you have not concluded your primary academic pursuit.</p>
<p class="article">For the young ladies, it is not a very palatable experience being pregnant while in school. So, this will put some pressure on your education for now. Even if you think you are physically strong and can cope with both school activities and the pregnancy, some schools will not allow you access to their classrooms in that state. They may advice you to go deliver your baby first before continuing with school.</p>
<p class="article">This may put a temporary halt or a permanent stop to your academic pursuit. To some, it will be two wasted years of break from their academics. The first year (or nine months thereabout) is to carry the pregnancy to term, while the second year will be to wean the child, after which they can resume school. Too bad! At this time, they will be two years behind their age mates in school, and will be classmates with their younger ones. You sure do not want that to happen to you.</p>
<p class="article">For some others, this will be the final episode of their academic pursuit as they may never ever get another opportunity to return to school. They jeopardize their future by themselves through some moments of enjoyment. What a great sacrifice to pay for a few moments of pleasure.</p>
<p class="article">If you live a chaste life, you will never have to bother with unwanted pregnancy. The only virgin about whom it was prophesied that will be pregnant without having sexual intercourse has since fulfilled the prophecy and given birth to Jesus Christ our Lord. Every other pregnancy since then came as a result of a male and a female having a sexual knowledge of each other.</p> 
<p class="article">If you do not engage in such sexual knowledge or anything related to it, you will not need to bother about whether or not you are pregnant, or be scared that a lady will come to tell you the most dreaded statement of wayward boys “I missed my period”. Your mind will be at rest, since you know that you cannot have a result in an examination which you did not write. It is impossible.</p>
<p class="article">Do not let sex turn you into a mother until love has turned you into a wife.</p>
