	<h3>SCREEN YOUR ASSOCIATION</h3>
<p class="article">The kind of people you move with, will determine, to a large extent, if you will stay a virgin, and for how long you will. If all of your friends are those who have lost theirs and who do not see anything bad in their actions, but keep celebrating from time to time their frequent sensual experiences with members of the opposite sex, chances are that they may talk you into joining their immoral group until you unconsciously begin to see nothing wrong with their way of life. </p>
<p class="article">If that happens, you are as good as gone. It will only take a matter of weeks or months before you begin to tell the same story of those good old days when you were still a virgin. Then you will discover that those stories are not really being told with pleasure and gladness of heart; they are really sad tales coated with glamour, just like bitter pills packaged in capsules. Then it will be too late for remedy. </p>
<p class="article">Be careful who you move with. Surround yourself only with members of the opposite sex who truly respect your decision to remain chaste and keep your virginity. Although they may not necessarily support your decision, and they may not be one themselves, but they never will encourage you to lose it. Carefully screen the friends and classmates who always look down on your status and who often try to talk you out of it. Staying around them can be costly. They may even set you up to be defiled, if you are not careful.</p>
<p class="article">Once you discover a particular group of persons who always make you feel insecure about your status, or who intentionally frequently engage in activities that may encourage your change of mind, or make you feel uncomfortable about your virginity, stay away from them.  Some of them may necessarily not be bad in themselves, but they can become a strong negative influence on your life.</p>
<p class="article">Some of them, whenever they are around you, will constantly boast of their sexual escapades, and the material things they have been able to accumulate in return as a result of these carnal adventures. This is just to make you feel inferior to them. However, always bear in mind that either internationally or locally, nobody has ever been given an honorary award as a result of the number of sexual exploits they have had in life. Sleeping around with members of the opposite sex does not increase one’s chances of success in life.</p>
<p class="article">Do not be discouraged by the number of your friends who have lost theirs untimely. Do not settle for less. Most of the people who prefer to boast about their sexual prowess only do this to cover up their inferiority complex. So, you will find many of your friends brag about their sexual prowess, the number of sexual partners they have, and how good they have enjoyed the sexual experiences. These brags are not really true. Some of them only say these things to gain societal respect from their colleagues and friends. Do not be lured into doing what you will later regret simply because of someone’s sugarcoated tongue.</p>
<p class="article">Do not just stupidly trust friends. If you decide to remain their friends, enjoying their stories without being a part of their sexual adventures, they may jealously organize for you, although without your knowledge, someone who will deflower you.  This will be worse for you as you will not have the choice to decide who you share your first sexual experience with.</p>
<p class="article">If you must maintain your virginity, you must scrutinize your relationships. If you keep friends who are drunkards, or who smoke, or who go clubbing and partying from time to time, you are putting yourself in a tight corner. Everyone who moves with the wrong crowd ends up in the wrong destination. </p>
<p class="article">Always bear in mind that what you want from life is different from what they want from life. Each person’s desires about the future differ from those of others. Whatever virtue you imbibe will determine if your desires will materialize. If you do not want to end up where and how they are sure to end up, then hold on to the values that will ensure that.</p>
<p class="article">Do not keep friends whose values contradict what you believe. It is the fastest way to lose your virginity. For all you care, some of them only brag about what they do not do so as to entice you into it. Most of the things they claim they do are just things they watch in movies or were told by other friends. Do not just sit idly around them feeling life has been unfair to you. Do not wish you have the opportunities they had. Leave their circle and go look for real friends who will help and encourage you to do something more important with your life. </p>
<p class="article">This is not to say you should isolate yourself and live a lonely life. Feel free, enjoy yourself, and make friends, but always remember that birds of the same feathers flock together. If you flock together with them, you will soon become of the same feather with them. If you remain in a group and all of the girls there have lost their virginity except you, then you are the next on line! Change your friends; if you do not change your friends, they will soon change you. </p>
