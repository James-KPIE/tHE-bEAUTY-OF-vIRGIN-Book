	<p class="article"><strong>1.	SUICIDE</strong><br >
Some commit suicide. They take their own lives because they feel there is nothing worth living for anymore since they have lost the only person they feel understands them in the world. They can not imagine that someone they trust so much will desert them for another person, and so they end their own lives untimely. What a wasted life!<br >

<strong>2.	MURDER</strong><br >
Some have their hands stained with blood. They commit murder by taking the life of the new lover whom their former lover has found. They feel they cannot stand having to see someone else share the person they love. Some people even prefer to take the life of the ex-lover; if they cannot have him/her, no one else should.<br >

<strong>3.	CELIBACY</strong><br >
Some decide never to marry again in life. This is because they believe there is no true love anywhere in the world, since they tested one and failed at it. These ones always claim “All men are the same” or “All women are the same”. This statement is not true. It is just based on the past experiences they have had with one or two people.<br >

<strong>4.	REVENGE</strong><br >
Some others take very destructive actions, either against themselves, their loved ones, or the intruder in the relationship. We have heard stories of young adults fighting openly over a member of the opposite sex. There are even cases of people baptizing one another with acid. These things can be avoided.</p>

<p class="article">All these wrong actions and conclusions are as a result of young people embarking too early on something they could have waited for the right time for. If you do not want to fall into the same spirit of error, keep your virginity, it has lots of reward.</p>
