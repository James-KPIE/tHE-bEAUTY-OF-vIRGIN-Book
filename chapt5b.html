	<h3>DECIDE NEVER TO SUCCUMB TO PRESSURE FOR MORE</h3>
						<p class="article">Make a conscious decision to stay chaste all of your life. It starts from here: self-determination. Determine not to give in to any pressure from whatever quarters. It is your life, and you decide who you allow into it and who you do not. </p>
						<p class="article">The reason why you fell in the first place was because you had no personal decision to remain chaste all of your youthful life. It is now time you made this concrete decision. Promise yourself to not succumb to pressure again.</p>
						<p class="article">That you have lost you virginity is not enough excuse to keep your legs wide open for anyone who cares to have his way. Build a strong moral character. You can repackage yourself and rebrand your life. Make a strong commitment to a chaste life. </p>
						<p class="article">There will be both external and internal pressures. The external pressure will come from people around you who have had carnal knowledge of you before. The internal pressure will come from your body. Since you already have an experience of what it is like, once in a while your body will feel like having the experience again. You need to be firm in your decision not to go back to that filthy lifestyle.</p>
						<p class="article">With this decision, a whole lot of things will change in your life, so be ready for it. You cannot live your life the way you have always lived it and still expect that things will naturally change for the better. You have to intentionally take the bull by the horn, and decide that you will do what you have to do in order to get what you need to get. It all starts with this decision. Once the decision is made, and you are sincere about it, then the die is cast!</p>
