	<h3>YOU ARE CREATED TO WAIT</h3>
						<p class="article">You must forget what the society wants you to believe; you are created to wait for the right time. The Master Designer of the universe has perfectly fabricated the intricate design of both a young man and a young woman such that it can withstand whatever pressure comes from external forces, as long as the person is willing to cooperate with God and live a chaste life.</p>
						<p class="article">Each manufacturer always places an instruction manual on each new piece of equipment. As long as the end user keeps to the terms of usage in the manual, he enjoys the product as it delivers at maximal capacity during usage. If the end user decides not to go by the recommendation of the manufacturer as stated in the instruction manual, he constantly encounters challenges that are avoidable.</p>
						<p class="article">God’s instruction manual says you are created to wait. Everywhere the issue is mentioned in the scriptures, God’s stand is not mistaken. Marriage is honourable when the bed is undefiled. This is the way God created it, and to get the best of what God intends you get through it, it has to be done His way.</p>
						<p class="article">God is not a wicked taskmaster who gives instructions inconsiderably. He understands the challenges you will go through in order to make this possible. He understands the pressure you will receive from members of the opposite sex who think you are acting immature at your age; the discouragement from members of the same sex who feel you are just being paranoid, and the unreasonable looks from immoral members of the society who think you are just taking things too far.</p>
						<p class="article">Despite all these, God still expects you to wait for the right time, because He created you to wait. He has fashioned in your make up during creation all the abilities you need to wait successfully. If only you will trust Him, He will help you.</p>
