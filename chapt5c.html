	<h3>LET ALL YOUR SEX PARTNERS KNOW YOUR NEW DECISION</h3>
						<p class="article">It is one thing to take this great decision in the corner of your room, but it gives the decision more credibility and integrity to let all the stakeholders know about it. This may be a difficult task; it is not going to look as easy as it sounds, but it has to be done. </p>
						<p class="article">Personally call, one by one, as many people as you know whom you are vulnerable to, people you have previously been exposed to and you know you are helpless in their grip, and tell them of you new decision. An easy way to do this is to send text messages to them or communicate it through the social media, but this can have a negative feedback as they may show it to their friends and you may become a laughing stock among them. It is better for you to make voice calls.</p>
						<p class="article">Tell them about your new decision. Let them realize you have made mistakes in the past, but now, you want to start your life afresh. Tell them you appreciate their friendship in times past, and that you will still appreciate such friendship in this new phase of your life only on one condition, that they will remain a friend, and not a sex partner.</p>
						<p class="article">Do not bother to answer any question from them. Just drop the call whenever you are through with what you have in mind to say. Entertaining questions may give them the opportunity to try to convince you to change your mind, or allow them time to apologize for whatever wrong they have done to make you take such a decision, and their words and pleas may get at you. Really, it is not about what they have done, it is about what your eyes have been opened to. </p>
						<p class="article">Some of them may be smart enough to play a quick one on you by asking for at least one more chance of sexual escapade to mark a memorable final sendoff for you. That one more chance can be deadly. So, just deliver your message and call it quits.</p>
						<p class="article">If the person agrees to identify with your new status, he may still remain your friend. If you find out that temptations to go back to what you used to be are coming from that end, then shut the door for life. You are not in enmity; you are safeguarding your future.</p>
