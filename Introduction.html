						<h3 class="heading-section">Introduction</h3>
						<p>Years ago, young boys and girls who were not married were trained to always look down on their counterparts who had lost their virginity and were sexually active. The beauty and the dignity of virginity was highly extolled, appreciated, and rewarded, even on the wedding day. </p>
						<p>Now, the story is different. Young adults who have lost theirs untimely and under the most unreasonable circumstances seem to be the most celebrated while those who hold on to theirs are fast becoming endangered species in our communities. Virgins now are mocked, embarrassed, molested and looked down upon. They are constantly pressured by peers to join their counterparts who have lost theirs. </p>
						<p>The society is saturated with sex. So much emphasis is placed on immorality and promiscuity such that it looks as though it is the right thing to do. It is so broadcasted and encouraged everywhere that you cannot miss it. From the musicals, to the videos, the cover pages of magazines, the billboard adverts, and even to the clothes that some teenagers wear. And worst of all, to some religious houses! </p>
						<p>In the pasts, so many cultures will go to the extent of making a public embarrassment of young girls who lost their virginity before their wedding nights. This is done (not to make the boys feel they are free to do anything they like, since the girls will suffer the shame) with the mindset that if the girls can hold jealously to their virginity, the boys, even if they want to mess around, will have no one to mess around with, and will therefore be forced to keep themselves pure till the glorious day. </p>
						<p>What do we have these days? Boys and girls who have discovered their sexuality very early in life and do not feel any shame about it. This is the age of promiscuous living. Men from all nations, tribes, cultures, and civilizations are frantically doing all in their power to find more than enough excuses to justify premarital sex. </p>
						<p>The society is not making matters any better. Although, premarital sex is not legally approved in many modern societies, however, the social media, technological advancement, and the pornographic industry have created ample privileges for young girls and boys to have very deep and close interactions. These interactions give them enough time together, and can lead to experimenting their sexuality by practicing the things they have seen both on the internet and on the television screens. </p>
						<p>In essence, the present day youths and teenagers have become very sexually aggressive, and the earlier we reckon with this fact and take preventive measures to guard against the sexual challenges of the day, the better for every one. These measures will make us become more restrictive in the way we conduct ourselves sexually. </p>
						<p>Truly, virginity is meant to be lost, but the timing of the loss, coupled with the circumstances that surround it, and who it is being lost to, are as important as the act of the loss itself. </p>
						<p>For the purpose of this write up, virginity will be defined as the state of remaining chaste and pure by abstaining from all forms of sexually related knowledge of a personâ€™s body parts, either with a member of the same sex or the opposite sex. </p>
