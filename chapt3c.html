	<h3>IT SHOWS YOU ARE DISCIPLINED</h3>
						<p class="article">Keeping your virginity will show to your spouse that  you are a very disciplined person with good strength of character, and that you can patiently control your emotions even under seriously heated pressures.</p>
						<p class="article">Not all young men or women can do that. So many will break down with slight sexual pressure from a member of the opposite sex and before they recover their senses, the unexpected would have happened. To have remained a virgin up till now, despite the strong desires and emotional pressures you have to battle with on daily basis, shows that you are a strong specie. Forget those who call themselves big boys and big girls around you. You are the real big boy here. You are the real big girl.</p>
						<p class="article">The good news is that if you are strong enough to keep it till now, you are strong enough to keep it till the right time. What it takes to keep it till the right time is not much more demanding than what it took to get you here. So there is no cause for alarm.</p>
						<p class="article">Secondly, if you have been able to discipline yourself in this area of your life with this much level of success, it shows that if you are really determined to, you can discipline yourself in any other area of your life and still achieve a very high level of success. If you are disciplined enough to withstand sexual pressure, you can withstand almost every other pressure, if you so desire.</p>
						<p class="article">This is another goodnews for you. You can make up your mind to be successful in life. You can determine to be the best student in your class, department, faculty, or neighbourhood. You may even desire to be the best employee in your working place, or the best employer in your field of endeavour. If you face it with the same level of discipline that helped you maintain your virginity till now, you will achieve it.</p>
