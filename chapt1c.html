	<h3 align="left">HE CLAIMS TO LOVE ME AND I LOVE HIM TOO</h3>
						<p class="article">So many young adults who do not know what love means always claim to love each other.  All they know about love in their entire lives is what they read in a romantic novel, watched in a pornographic movie or heard from their mates, and in each of these cases, the two love birds had to sleep together because they are in love. </p>
						<p class="article">The fact that you are in love with a person is not a ready license to make love with the person. Falling in love does not mean you are matured enough to handle a relationship or that you are ripe enough for sex. Do not be fooled by love. Do not let your heart deceive you. There is a very thin line between love and infatuation, and it takes a very mature heart to know the boundary. </p>
						<p class="article">Ask yourself this sincere question, what does it mean to fall in love? If you give a sincere answer from your heart to this question, you will discover that loving someone practically has nothing to do with sleeping with them. If the two mean the same thing to you, then your reasoning has probably been corrupted by the wrong information you have been feeding on, and you will need a re-orientation. </p>
						<p class="article">Sex is not a casual one-night thing; it is much more than that. It involves genuine emotional, psychological, and physical attraction whose test of love is proven and confirmed on the wedding day.</p>
