	<h3>THREATS TO QUIT IF I DO NOT</h3>
						<p class="article">It is common place to find one party in an intimate friendship threatening to quit the relationship simply because the other party is not cooperating to satisfy the otherâ€™s lustful desires. This should not be a problem. </p>
						<p class="article">The first thing to note here is that it does not make much sense to displease yourself in order to please someone who cannot displease himself to please you. If he/she is really committed to you, and is very much interested in you, he/she will stay with you, and will wait for you until you are ready for sexual acts. If he/she is threatening to quit, both parties will be the better for it. Just as the popular saying, winners do not quit, it simply means he is not your winner. Good riddance to bad rubbish they say. Whoever cannot wait until you are ready for it should vanish. </p>
						<p class="article">If you are a female and you think obliging a male his request for sex will make the relationship stronger, you will need to have a rethink. No lady has ever been able to tie a man to her apron with sex. If, by whatever means, you erroneously thinks you have succeeded in imprisoning the man in your sex cage, you will soon find out that this cage has no latch and that the man can only remain there for as long as he chooses to. At any time, he can fly out and try other cages around.</p>
						<p class="article">Pre-marital sex is deceptive. It gets you more confused than you really are. It makes you think you are closer than you actually are, and makes you feel you love the person much more than you really do. It beclouds your sense of reasoning and makes you think that the person is the best thing that has ever happened to you. It will be too late for you when you finally discover that you have not succeeded in caging the other person but have actually caged yourself.</p>
						<p class="article">Whoever wants to walk out of a relationship should be allowed to, and should not be forced to stay, especially if they think that the only thing that can keep them is sex. Do not feel bad that you have to lose such a person. If your friend decides to jilt you because you refuse to have sex, that will be a good way to quit the relationship. It means he never really loved you in the first place. He just wanted someone to use and dump, and since you are not available to be used, you can as well be dumped in search of an easier catch.</p>
						<p>If you are in a courtship that is intended to lead to marriage and your partner constantly troubles you, demanding for sex, then you should know that that partner is a SID (Sexually Impatient Dog). You may see nothing wrong with this now, but wait till both of you are married and one party has to travel for a few weeks, it is then you will know that you are in the wrong hands.</p>
