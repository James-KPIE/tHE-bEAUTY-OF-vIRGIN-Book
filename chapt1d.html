	<h3>IT IS A PROOF OF LOVE</h3>
						<p class="article">Another common reason why most young adults lose their virginity is because they feel that sex is a proof of love. It is common to hear those in intimate relationships with members of the opposite sex say:  “if you love me, then show it”. And the only way they expect you to show it is by giving up your virginity and sleeping around with them. This sounds very selfish! This statement does not always only come from the masculine to the feminine gender. The world is so bad now that even the female in the relationship, at times, place much more sexual demands on the males who have vowed to remain unmoved till the right time. </p>
						<p class="article">Sex is not the proof of love. It was never the proof of love before now and will never be in the ages to come. Who says sex is anyway? Only those who desire to get through your laps at all cost, and they will tell any lie, no matter how ridiculous it sounds, just to make sure you allow them.</p>
						<p class="article">The reality of life is that you do not love someone because of what the person does. You love someone because of who the person is, regardless of what he or she does, or does not do. Basing the proof of love on what your partner can or cannot give is unrealistic. Love is not about what you can get from the other person, but what you can give out to the person. If all you are interested in is what you can get, then it is not love.</p>
						<p class="article">If your are in a relationship and your partner desires that you prove the genuineness of your love, and the only way demanded is sex, then what is expected is not just a proof of love, but a show of your foolishness. Know this for sure; no one has ever succeeded in tying down another person with sex. You may have a hold on the person for a while because he or she has access to the most intricate part of your body, but this will not last for long. He/she will soon get a better offer from someone else whenever he/she has had enough of you. This will happen because your relationship is outside marriage. </p>
						<p class="article">Please release such persons and let them go. No relationship is worth keeping, if the condition for its survival is to lay hold on your golden tulip. Do not sacrifice your virginity for love, it is not always worth it; such love is always temporal and you will soon be back to square one, no matter how much you try. </p>
						<p class="article">Whoever tells you again that sex is a proof of love, ask him to say that to a prostitute. He will be laughed to scorn. A prostitute sleeps with numerous men on daily basis but has no emotional attachment to any of them. She forgets about each one the moment he is done and prepares herself for the next client. Sleeping with someone you are not married to is actually not the proof of love but the absence of it. </p>
						<p class="article">Sex is not a proof of love. Patience should be a better proof of love. If you are in a relationship and actually love your partner, you will be patient until the right time. If your partner also loves you, she will also not put you under any sexual pressure until the right time. You both will be patient until the right time. </p>
						<p class="article">Patience and time always work together to prove things right or wrong. If you really love each other, time will prove it, because you will be patient for one another till the right time. So, patience is the real proof of love. </p>
