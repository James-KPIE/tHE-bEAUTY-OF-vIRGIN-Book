	<h3>THE PLEASURE OF THE MOMENT</h3>
						<p class="article">Some people lost their virginity for the pleasure of the moment. They got carried away in a moment of ecstasy and so could not control their nerves until the glory of their sexuality was taken away from them. If most of these ones will, sincerely, make a genuine confession from their hearts to you, you will discover that they later regret their actions. They secretly wish it never happened because that day marked an irreversible turning point in their lives. What they thought was a momentary pleasure later became an eternal shame that cannot be wished away. </p>
						<p class="article">Momentary pleasure that carries with it perpetual displeasure is no pleasure at all. You must make a choice between instant pleasure that is brief and sweet, but carries with it a long lasting torment, and a chaste life now that will be rewarded with a long lasting life of pleasure. The choice is yours. </p>
						<p class="article">It is naturally human not to want to wait for the right time to enjoy the pleasures that rightly belong to us. This is because we want to feel what our mates are feeling; we want to belong; we want to be numbered among the happening guys/girls around. Man will rather enjoy today and suffer tomorrow than deprive himself of the unripe forbidden fruit today so that he can have a brighter and more colorful fruit tomorrow. The wise always wait. Only the foolish fall into such temptations!
						<p class="article">It has been argued that of all pleasurable moments, the act of lovemaking is the peak of human excitements and climaxes his enjoyable experiences. This, however, is when done within the confinement allowed by the One whom it originated from. When done outside this confinement, it brings guilt, shame, hatred, regrets, bitterness, and self-pity. </p>
						<p class="article">There is nothing wrong with sex. It is pleasurable. God made it to be enjoyed. However, there is everything wrong with it when it is not done at the right time. Your virginity is your most cherished possession and you sure do not want to lose it to someone who does not cherish or respect you. Learn to wait. The brief pleasure of the moment is nothing compared to the eternal enjoyment of marital bliss. Do not allow immediate gratification to hinder your future joy. </p>
						<p class="article">Did you ever steal meat from the pot while it was still cooking? The moment the hot piece of meat lands in your mouth, rather than enjoy every bite of it, it comes with some sharp pains, burns your tongue and gives you blisters in your mouth. It leaves you with more pain than pleasure. The stolen piece of meat has to be swallowed without being well eaten. This haste denies one the maximal pleasure one would have derived from the stolen piece of meat if it had been eaten in the presence of all, on a dining table. The experience would have surely been better if you had waited until the meat was served at the right time. </p>
						<p class="article">This is the reason why every young adult is encouraged to wait for the right time, and the right person to catch the right pleasure. There are other forms of pleasure you can still catch now that are not sexually related, and that will not make it look as though you are missing the hot piece of meat which your mates are stealing from the cooking pot. </p>
