	<h3>SET A PERSONAL LIMIT FOR YOURSELF</h3>
<p class="article">Set yourself a limit. Decide how far you want to get, ever before a tempting situation arises. If you do not set a limit and suddenly discover that you need to take a decision because you are right in the midst of an unpalatable situation, you may make a choice that you will later regret in life. So, create a boundary now.</p>
<p class="article">Set a personal limit for yourself and do not go beyond it. Setting a limit helps you know what to do when anything happens. You have already planned the reaction to each action ahead, and nothing should catch you unaware. All you do when you find yourself in such situation is to act out the script you have written ahead of time. It saves you a whole lot of pressured reasoning and impromptu actions.</p>
<p class="article">Set your own boundaries and constantly remind yourself about them, especially before a date and before going to any party. Without these limits, you may be carried away by the spur of the moment, and will just do whatever you feel is right at the moment of trial. Since your emotions are not yet fully trained to know when to stop, and you have not set limits, your normal reaction to do what is right at the moment will be subject to your sense of judgment at that moment, with your sense of judgment already beclouded by the excitement and pleasure of the moment. So, you are most likely going to take an impromptu decision that will favor your feelings at that moment, and that may be disastrous.</p>
<p class="article">Now that you can still reason straight, with no pressure from any angle, make decisions that will determine how far you will get with a member of the opposite sex at any given situation and in the worst case. Will it be just holding hands, or just a simple innocent hug, a peck on the cheek, or whatever? Take these decisions now, and let these decisions guide your actions on daily basis from now on.</p>
<p class="article">Whenever anyone is going beyond these boundaries, no matter the level of closeness to the person, and irrespective of where you are at the moment, either in the public glare or in your privacy, do not be ashamed to let the person know he is going beyond his boundary. It may be difficult to say this the first few times, but overtime, if you keep reminding him, your friend will respect your decisions and you will not have to say it again.</p>
<p class="article">Your initial natural reaction will be to reluctantly allow the person to have his way for the first time, even if it is against your will, so as not to embarrass the person, with a determination to speak out the next time he dares try it again. However, from experience, it has been discovered that if you allow him go beyond that boundary the first time, it will be difficult to keep him away from crossing the line again. </p>
<p class="article">Do not be so shy that you will allow your destiny to be truncated. It is better for your friend to feel embarrassed for a moment and you apologize later, than for you to be shy in a moment, and save him the embarrassment, but live to regret it for life.</p>
