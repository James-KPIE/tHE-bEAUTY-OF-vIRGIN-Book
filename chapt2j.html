	<h3>SINGLE PARENTAGE</h3>
<p class="article">The families can agree that they do not want any abortion and both parties should go their separate ways. In this case, the young lady is allowed to give birth to the baby but not to continue her relationship with the father of the baby.</p>
<p class="article">This allows the two of them to continue with their separate lives as though nothing has happened. The parents and the society would expect that after the delivery of the baby, the three (father, mother & child) will live their normal lives again, but this seldom is the case.</p>
<p class="article">The young father and the mother will live apart as single parents, with all or some of the responsibilities of child rearing being shouldered by them at such a very early age. This puts so much pressure and stress on the two of them as they can no longer live like their age matesâ€™. They have already put themselves in bondage. </p>
<p class="article">As the child grows by the day, it becomes increasingly difficult for each of them to sustain a real relationship that will mature into marriage with another party, since the issue of the child they have had out of wedlock keeps coming up, no matter how much they try to cover it. All things being equal, no young man with a promising future really desires to marry a lady who had given birth before. So also, no young lady wants to willfully marry a man who has a child already from another woman. The child now becomes a clog in their wheel of marital progress. It is not as though it is practically impossible for them to marry normally again, but it will take much more from them than if they were still single.</p>
<p class="article">If they successfully conceal the information from the new partner before the marriage, at whatever point the secret is revealed, the revelation always threatens the marriage with divorce, and only very few people have been able to manage such situations successfully.</p>
<p class="article">The child also grows up in an abnormal family. Since he would be raised by a single parent from babyhood, his perception of family life will surely be distorted. It is even possible that growing up may be tough for him because he will be denied some amenities of life which his mates who grew up in normal families would have access to. He is likely to have low grades in school work, drop out of school midway without graduating, and stand a high chance of being abused sexually, physically and other wise. He, most likely, will also be neglected.</p>
<p class="article">If the parents are lucky enough to find someone to marry later on in life, the child will have to either live with a foster parent or step parent. This will put an innocent child through undue stress, simply because of few minutes of indiscipline and uncontrolled emotions from his separated parents. Very few of such children, when they eventually grow up and are lucky to be prospered by God, are willing to forgive their parents. It is not their fault; you may do worse if you were in their shoes.</p>
