    <h3>EVERYONE IS DOING IT</h3>
						<p class="article">One major reason why most young adults lose their virginity is because they believe the lie told by their wayward friends that everyone around them has lost theirs. This is a blatant lie. The reason why they say this is because they want to make you feel like a lonely person fighting a lost battle. </p>
						<p class="article">Do not be deceived that you are the only person who has not yet lost yours. You are not alone. You are not fighting a lost battle. You are not a one-man-army. You are not the only person around who has not been deflowered yet. </p>
						<p class="article">Do not let anyone convince you otherwise. Virgins, either males or females, are not endangered species. There are numerous people around, just like you, who are still as intact as God created them. There are billions of your age mates around the world, countless millions in your country, thousands in your state, and so many hundreds in your locality who still believe in what you believe in and will wait until the right time to do what has to be done. </p>
						<p class="article">It is a great deception to agree with them that all young adults are doing it. Even some very popular stars do not do it. Celine Dion kept her virginity till she married at 26. Jessica Simpson also stayed a virgin until she got married. She wore a purity ring which she received from her father, and she religiously kept her promise to him. Phoebe Lisa Kudrow, though always featured as wild, also remained single till she was 32, and she gave her husband her much preserved gift of her virginity on her wedding night. Andriana Lima married as a virgin at 27, and Taylor Swift as well. Your friends who are trying to convince you that being a virgin is a lack of opportunity need to come ask this globally famous star. Do not be deceived, either by them or by the media, not everyone is doing it. </p>
						<p class="article">Virgins are not loners. The fact that you have not met many people of your age group who are still completely intact does not mean that everybody around is eating the forbidden fruit. They are everywhere: young boys and young ladies, in your classroom, in your school, in your church, in your neighborhood, they are everywhere around you.</p>
						<p class="article">The reason why you do not know them is the same reason why they do not know you. Everyone is shy to be proud of what naturally carries pride. This is the environment in which we have found ourselves. If all the virgins around: males and females, will have a common front, those who are  disvirgined will hide their heads in shame. They will be too shocked to discover that, there are many more young adults who have kept themselves chaste and pure, than there are who are sleeping around shamelessly.
						<p class="article">Virginity is not something to be ashamed of. Let no one despise you, being a virgin does not make you an object of pity, it is a thing to be celebrated. In fact, the reverse should be the order. The one who is not a virgin should be the object of sympathy for losing so quickly what should have been kept till the wedding night.</p>
						<p class="article">On the other hand, they may want to make you feel bad by saying that your spouse-to-be is already enjoying himself or herself out there, while you are here holding on to your purity. Do not feel cheated because of this. The good news is, since you have chosen to live your life the moral way, there are so many members of the opposite sex out there who also have made this same decision. Someday, you will find one of such who will cherish and respect you for this decision. Then, your waiting will be worth it. It will not be for nothing. </p>
						<p class="article">You should not encourage yourself to engage in any act that is against your personal belief simply because someone told you that everyone is doing it. How did the person know that everyone is doing it? What research did he conduct? How many questionnaires did he send out? How many respondents replied him? How did he collate the results of the hypothesis before postulating his theory? </p>
						<p class="article">Do not let anyone deceive you by just generalizing untrue information. Everyone is not doing it. If it really looks like everyone is doing it in your locality, you are just being myopic. </p>
						<p class="article">Even if it is confirmed that everyone is truly doing it in your neighbourhood, you can stand alone. Be on the side of what is right. Let those who want to do it do it and you be the odd one out. Before you know it, others around you will see you as a good example to emulate and will join you, and you may soon become a leader to spearhead a new move in your neighbourhood. </p>
