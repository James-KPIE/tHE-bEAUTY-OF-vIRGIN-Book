	<h3>WHY YOU MUST PRESERVE YOUR VIRGINITY</h3>
						<h4 class="heading-section">A DESIRE TO HAVE A GLORIOUS FIRST-TIME EXPERIENCE</h4><br >
						<p class="article">Losing your virginity is a once-in-a-life-time experience and so should be treated as such, with so much celebrations and fun fare, it deserves nothing less.</p>
						<p class="article">Just as you would desire to throw a party to celebrate your convocation from the University, or to mark the christening of your first child when the time comes, because they are notable achievements in your life that comes just once in a life time, so also your Disvirginity Day; it is worth celebrating. </p>
						<p class="article">You can never forget your first experience of sexual intercourse. So you need to do it with someone very special. The only way to celebrate it is to wait for the day it is meant to be celebrated, which is your wedding day, and not in the corner of a room with a guy who does not know what his future holds yet, or at the back of a car with a girl who is just fantasizing about your giftings, talents and abilities.</p>
						<p class="article">Let your wedding night be an unforgettable experience for both you and your spouse. When you wait till the date it is meant to be celebrated, everybody will celebrate with you, and you will be glad you did. Beside everyone celebrating with you, your spouse will also celebrate with you on a special note that night. It will indeed be a memorable day for you. If you have quietly done it in one corner before then, others may celebrate it with you publicly, but there will be no special thing to celebrate with your spouse that night, the icing on the cake is already gone.</p>
						<p class="article">If you desire to have a glorious first-time experience, wait for the right time.</p>
