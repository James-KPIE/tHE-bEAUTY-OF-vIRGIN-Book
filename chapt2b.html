	<h3>DEALING WITH A STRANGER</h3>
<p class="article">Ask young men or young women who sleep around in your school, and you will discover that, most times, they have to deal with complete strangers, people they have very little or no knowledge about.</p>
<p class="article">Even if you have been friends with someone for some time, you really may not know the other party as much as you think you do. Once there is sexual contact, the time needed to intimate yourselves and familiarize with each other is spent consolidating on the previous sexual experience. The values, standards and the ideals of the other party are no longer important. All that is important is just the sex sessions.</p>
<p class="article">In no time, one becomes a sex toy to the other. They may be tempted to think that they know more of each other since they meet from time to time to discuss, but more often than not, what they know of each other are just peripherals, since all they do is just bodily exploration of one another. Rather than being knitted together in both their spirit and soul, they get knitted together only in bodily form. </p>
<p class="article">This is why, most of the time, most people who lose their virginity before marriage do not end up getting married to the one they lost it to. The reason is this, sometime along the way, one party’s eyes become opened to see that they really do not share the same values as they thought, and the relationship gets broken. It is at this point that both parties discover that they have been dealing with a complete stranger all along. All they know is just the body, not the spirit or the soul of the person.</p>
<p class="article">There are too many things one is supposed to know about another person than their sexual performance. You do not how the person relates with his siblings, what his friends think of him, how serious he is with God, how he handles monetary matters, his reactions under pressure, crisis management skills, financial management ability, leadership skills, and all of that. </p>
<p class="article">If all you know is just the sexual ability, you are in for a problem. Judging a person or keeping a relationship with a person singularly because of the person’s performance ability under the bed sheets is quite ridiculous. Leaving sex out of your intimate relationship truly allows you time to learn more about the person you are dealing with, so that you can decide if you really want to keep close to the person or not.</p>
