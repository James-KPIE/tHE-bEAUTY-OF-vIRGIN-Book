	<h3>IT WILL HELP YOU KNOW YOURSELF</h3>
						<p class="article">Some teenagers erroneously believe that losing their virginity at a very early age in life will help them to get in touch with themselves. They believe that it will help them to know or understand themselves well enough. </p>
						<p class="article">This is not true. This only helps them activate the passive sexual stimuli in them, thereby making them desire more of such romantic experiences, and the result is exposure to more sexual dangers. </p>
						<p class="article">These sexual stimuli need not get activated until they are well matured and ready for use. It is not about its availability for use, it will always be available, but it is more importantly about its readiness for use, and this readiness, by God's standard, is confirmed by one thing - marriage. </p>
						<p class="article">It is just like having a brand new sim card pack without a phone. A wise man waits patiently until he has a cell phone he can call his own before activating it. A foolish man looks for any available phone around, borrows it for a minute, and activates it without having a phone of his own. </p>
						<p class="article">Once this mistake is done, he needs to keep looking for people around whose phones he can always readily borrow for a minute so as to keep checking his text messages and keep recharging to avoid being disconnected from the network. The constant insertion and removal of the sim card wears off the microchip on the sim and it, in no time, will need a replacement. This is because it was not designed to serve multiple phones at the same time. </p>
						<p class="article">This is the same way sex is. Once you taste the forbidden fruit, you will always be attracted to it each time an opportunity presents itself to have a taste of it again. It takes greater discipline and determination to stay without it thereafter, than is needed to stay without it if you are still untouched. This is why it is called the forbidden fruit when tasted before the right time.  </p>
						<p class="article">Come to think of it, it is so surprising what people are willing to believe. How on earth will losing your virginity help you to know yourself? Will it help you to discover your purpose in life? Will it help you to discover your academic ability? Will it help you to discover your gifts and talents? The answers to these are obvious. Losing your virginity, be you a male or a female, has nothing to do with the discovery of yourself! The only part of you it will open your eyes to is your sexuality; it will in no way help you to discover any real and reasonable thing about your life. </p>
						<p class="article">If you really desire to know yourself, losing your virginity is not an option. You can meet a counsellor around you who will take you through a self-discovery course, or get a copy of my book MAKE MONEY WHILE IN SCHOOL, it will help you a great deal. </p>
