	<h3>NEVER BE ASHAMED TO MAKE YOUR STAND KNOWN</h3>
<p class="article">Do not be scared to let people know what you believe in. Male or female, you should be proud of being a virgin. Do not let anyone make you feel bad for believing and accepting to do what is right.  </p>
<p class="article">As much as possible, respect the choice of others who believe what they believe, but let them also respect your choice for standing for purity. They, likely, may not respect this choice of yours for as long as you keep it to yourself. So, do not be scared to let them know where you stand. Until they know what you stand for they may not respect what you believe. </p>
<p class="article">During conversations among your group of friends, do not say what you do not believe in or admit what you have never done before just because you want to fit in. Make your stand known. They may feel offended the first time, but overtime, they will come to agree with you that it is your choice, and that it is the right choice, whether they say it to you or not. </p>
<p class="article">Once your stand is known, each time you expressed contrasting opinion about such issues during conversations, they will respect your view as your choice. If you take this stand, more people in the group, who before now were shy to identify themselves as virgins, will become bold as a result of your actions, and will begin to make their stands known. That is when you will discover that you are not the only one who believes in the preservation of virginity in your community.</p>
<p class="article">In making your stand known, you will have to limit it to the people you trust. This will include your family members and your close friends. You really do not have to take a megaphone and climb to the topmost floor of the highest building around in order to broadcast to the whole wide world that you are still a virgin. Be careful about it. Some people may want to use the information to harm you. So, avoid disclosing it to those who are not very close to you. However, whenever the situation warrants it, or whenever you are forced to disclose your status, never be ashamed to let people know where you stand.  It is not a crime to be a virgin; it is a thing of pride.</p>
