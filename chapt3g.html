	<h3>BETTER ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE</h3>
						<p class="article">Keeping your purity as a student has a way of increasing your academic performance in school. </p>
						<p class="article">Frequent involvement in sexual activities before one is married can cause a lot of distractions in life, both to males and females alike. Some of these distractions are highlighted in the last chapter titled “Dangers of Premarital Sex.” </p>
						<p class="article">As a result of these distractions, sexually active teenagers and youths are likely to give less attention to their academics compared to their counterparts who have suspended all sexual activities till marriage. This loss of concentration may not be very visible during class periods, but it will become more obvious when you compare the academic performance of the two groups after the examination. </p>
						<p class="article">You will discover that more of those who are sexually chaste will do excellently well, while only few of those whose lives have been smeared with sexual filth can afford to match the other group’s performance.</p>
						<p class="article">Virgins, most times, are focussed. Their minds are not distracted by sexual impurities, how to please a partner, heartbreaks, fear of pregnancy, and the like. In addition to the desire to please God at all times, they have as their main focus, how to have a better academic performance. </p>
						<p class="article">This focus and undivided attention to their education helps them to give to it all it takes, and in return, they have better results than their sexually corrupt mates. </p>
