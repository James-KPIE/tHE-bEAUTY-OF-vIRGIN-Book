	<h3>HELPING THE NEEDY/DESPERATE</h3>
						<p class="article">Another related lie most young people believe is the urgent need for sex. Most teenagers and young adults have fallen for this accidentally. The one who is more sexually active of the duo can paint the impression of a desperado, as though something evil will happen to him or her if he does not have a member of the opposite sex to mess around with at that very moment. </p>
						<p class="article">Statements that will arouse pity from the other party may constantly be used so as to gain emotional support. Things like, “Just this once and i won’t disturb you again”, “It is either now or never”, “Why can not you be there for me when I need you most in my life”. “I do not know what can happen to me if I do not have you now”</p>
						<p class="article">When you begin to hear statements like this, your natural reaction will be to want to help a friend who is desperately in need, especially if you do not want to lose the relationship. However, be careful, because these statements are just the beginning of a well thought out plan whose major aim is to achieve one singular purpose in your life, which is to ensure you lose your most guided possession, your V card. </p>
						<p class="article">The irony of it is even the fact that you sacrificed your virginity to appease the gods of their sexual urges and the fact that you yielded when in a seemingly sexually demanding moment, does not mean that they will always love you. You are only needed to cool their sexual temper and satisfy their sensual urge for that moment, and, once your tenure is over, you will be discarded into the archives of their lives like a useless blood soaked sanitary pad. </p>
						<p class="article">Sex may be seen as the icing on the cake in a relationship, but it is not the real cake. Relationships need much more than sex to survive. If there are issues in your relationship with your closest friend, the problem is not because sex is not involved and the solution will not be sleeping together. </p>
						<p class="article">If two of you can sit down to talk about it or seek counsel from older ethical friends, your eyes may be opened to what the real problem is. Once this is tackled, you can relate closer without seeing each other’s pants. However, if you think the problem is sex, and both of you open your laps to each other, the problem will still surface over time, and then the inevitable will happen; you will ultimately lose your closest friend. Then you would have lost two major things in your life, your virginity and your friend. </p>
