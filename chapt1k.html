	<h3>TO GAIN EXPERIENCE IN PREPARATION FOR MARRIAGE</h3> 
						<p class="article">Another argument is experience or sexual compatibility. People claim they need the experience in order to prepare them ahead for the expectations of marriage. Their defence is that people who are new at a thing are really bad at it the first time. So they need to learn how to be better at it before the wedding night so that they will not be seen as learners or first-timers on the appointed day. </p>
						<p class="article">This also is not true. You need no prior experience to become better with regard to this issue. God did not create human beings to window shop for sexual experiences through erotic escapades. Indeed, if what you really desire is experience, maybe you should not only consider losing your virginity alone. You should go a step further and become a professional sex hawker, a whore, a slut, or a prostitute, since that is the only way to get all of the ‘needed experience.’ </p>
						<p class="article">There are several couples who married as virgins and no one ever heard them quarrelling with one another on their wedding nights simply because they did not know what to do with themselves. Some things in life are not taught, they are learnt naturally by intuition. No one teaches a day old baby how to suck the breast, he just happens to know it by instinct. It is not meant to be taught. </p>
						<p class="article">So it is with sex once you are married. You are a better married man/woman without the experiences that requires physical engagement with another before marriage. Trying to get these prior experiences will only make you live a very loose life, since there is no single sex-lecturer who will offer to give you all you need to know about it. </p>
						<p class="article">If your fear is connected to having sexual satisfaction in marriage, then put your mind at rest. All the experience you will ever need will come by intuition at the right time. Have you ever bothered to ask yourself who taught Adam and Eve how to go about it on their first night together, since they were the first couple on earth and had no pornographic video to watch or bed-mates to experiment with? Still, they did it right.  If they did not, they would not have given birth to Cain and Abel. </p>
						<p class="article">Sourcing for experience will do you more harm than good. This is because man was not created to have any experience in this regard. Sexual experience, if finally gotten, will make you place an unrealistic demand on your spouse, who may not have had all of the sexual experiences you have had. This may lead to lack of fulfilment in the sexual relationship of a couple, and may become the foundation for infidelity in the marriage. </p>
						<p class="article">If both parties in a marriage relationship keep themselves chaste before their wedding night, the peak of their expectations will be the best that each of them has to offer, both having no prior experience to compare the other with. Each party accepts what the other has to offer as the standard of all expectations. However, if one party has had a load of experiences with a couple of persons before marriage, there already exist benchmarks of expectations, which if not met, may lead to dissatisfaction. This dissatisfaction will be as a result of an unjust and biased comparism of the partner with previous sex-mates. This will create an urge which may later develop into sexual covetousness, and ultimately marital unfaithfulness. This is the major reason for divorce in marriages today. </p>
						<p class="article">Premarital sex prepares no one in advance for a happy sexual life in marriage. It only gives a temporary sensual pleasure that the parties may misconstrue to be real love, thereby blinding them to the real situation of the relationship. This is why people say ‘love is blind, but marriage is an eye opener’. </p>
						<p class="article">If your headache is sexual compatibility, what makes you think that if you are compatible today, you still will be compatible in five, or ten, or twenty years’ to come? The foundation for sexual happiness in marriage is trust, faithfulness, constant communication between the parties, contentment with what is available, and, fear of God. </p>
