						<h3>NOBODY WILL KNOW IF WE DO IT</h3>
						<p class="article">Another way to lure you to bed is the promise of secrecy. “I will keep it secret” “I won’t tell anyone about it” the other party seems to say, as though the issue is about who knows and who does not.
						<p class="article">Things should be put in the right perspective. If the action is wrong, why do it in the first place? What you do not want people to know, you do not engage in. What you think is a secret between the two of you may become open knowledge to the whole community someday. That is, if they do not know about it that same day and simply stay silent since it is supposed to be a secret.</p>
						<p class="article">All ladies need to know this: the only man who should be given the singular honour to have a carnal knowledge of you in the privacy of his room is the one who will publicly put a ring on your middle finger in the presence of your parents, and he is not allowed to do the former until he has done the latter.</p>
						<p class="article">Do not be encouraged to do what is wrong because of the promise of secrecy. Whether it is done in the public glare or in the privacy of a friend’s room, or somewhere hidden, what is wrong is wrong and should not be done at all. Even if you succeed in keeping it a secret from all men for life, there is Someone who sees all the intents of a man’s heart and knows what is done in secret; He will reward you accordingly. So, be careful what you do in secret.</p>
