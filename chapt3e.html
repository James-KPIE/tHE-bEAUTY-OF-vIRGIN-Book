	<h3>IT GIVES A SENSE OF DIGNITY</h3>
						<p class="article">Knowing that you are still as perfect as you were created will give you inner strength and self-respect. This inner strength and self-respect are great virtues required to have a fulfilled life. If you lose them, you lose something valuable in life. </p>
						<p class="article">In addition, it will give you a sense of dignity and honor before others who know your true status, especially your spouse. People still respect virgins, although, they do not say it openly. </p>
						<p class="article">More people give a lot of regard to those who are virgins. Those who have lost theirs respect them because the virgins have been able to keep what they could not keep. Those who have not lost theirs also respect them because they have a firsthand experience of what it means to be a virgin in this generation. Whichever way, those who are still as intact as God created them have dignity in the eyes of all. </p>

						<h3 class="heading-section">IT AFFECTS YOUR SPIRITUAL LIFE</h3>
						<p class="article">Virginity, in a sense, has to do with your spirituality. Most young adults do not know this. It is an important aspect of your spiritual life. There is a very close connection between the two. </p>
						<p class="article">God appreciates purity and chastity and keeping your virginity, in a sense, makes you pure and chaste. This indirectly puts you on some level of right standing before God when it comes to sexuality. </p>
						<p class="article">This is just simple reasoning! If virginity has nothing to do with your spiritual life and God does not appreciate virginity, why will He insist that Jesus must come through one? If the coming of Jesus into the world must be through a virgin, it shows the level of respect and regard that God has for young men and women who keep themselves chaste. </p>
						<p class="article">Young people who lose their virginity always feel dirty, used, unclean, and have a serious guilty conscience after the action. Each time they come into a spiritual environment, they feel odd and out of place. These feelings will go overtime, but it does not mean they are whole again, it only means their consciences have been seared. </p>
						<p class="article">This is a very bad state to find yourself in! Anyone in this state, can engage in sexually related sins wilfully, and come into the presence of God soon afterwards, pretending that all is well and without any feeling of remorse. There is already a severance between such a person and the Creator, and he does not know it. </p>
						<p class="article">If your sexual life is pure, to a larger extent, all other areas of your life are likely to be pure, and you can wholeheartedly worship God unreservedly, without holding back anything when you are in His presence. Even if some areas of your life are not so pure, it is easier for you to do something about it, than someone whose sexual life is already polluted with all manners of sexually related offences. Such a person will find it difficult to feel very free in the presence of God, knowing fully well that the things he has done in secrecy may be hidden from men, but are open to God before whom he stands. </p>
