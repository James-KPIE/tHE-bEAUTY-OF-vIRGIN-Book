	<h3>PROMISE OF MARRIAGE</h3>
						<p class="article">One other common excuse is the promise of marriage. Teenagers and youths are quick to say, “… Since we have promised to marry each other, why can not we sleep with each another”. “… If you are sure you are reserving yourself for me, why can not I have you now”. </p>
						<p class="article">This is another high level of deception. What makes you think that the other party will keep to this promise? He is human, and human beings change! There have been reports of cases of young adults who made marital promises to each other but failed to keep their words later on in life. There are even cases of those who took it a step further and covenanted with one another to marry each other in the future but still failed to keep to the covenant. So, be careful. </p>
						<p class="article">Promise of marriage from a friend is not enough to give your self to him/her. People change with time. Your closest friend today may not be your closest friend tomorrow, and if you let him or her have today what you cannot take back tomorrow, you will be at the losing end if the unexpected eventually happens. </p>
						<p class="article">Only God makes promises that do not fail. People will always fail. So, please keep your virginity. Do not allow any daughter of Belial or son of Beelzebub use sweet words to deny you what you have jealously guarded for years. Always put the statement in the right perspective. You are not reserving yourself for the boy or the girl in your life now; you are reserving yourself for the man or woman who will be lucky enough to be by your bed side on your wedding night. If he or she desires to be that lucky man or woman, (s)he will hold onto the promise and wait till the right time. If not, the right man who will wait will come at the right time. </p>
						<p class="article">Besides being a type of deception, it is also a show of shallow reasoning. If the other party can afford to keep to the promise, what makes you think you will want to keep to it in the nearest future? What if you meet another person who has better qualities than this present one and you become disinterested in this present offer? </p>
						<p class="article">You cannot begin to determine some vital things about the far future at this early stage. You do not even know all about yourself yet. You do not know if your preferences and your tastes tomorrow will be different from what they are now. Focus more on what is important in your life now. Your academics, your talents, your career, your relationship with God, and your immediate family members are issues you should devote more time to now, and not thoughts about marriage, when you still have close to a decade before you are really ready for it. </p>
