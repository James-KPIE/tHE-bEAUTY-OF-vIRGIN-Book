	<h3>PARENTAL PRESSURE</h3>
						<p class="article">One reason why some people get disvirgined before marriage is because of pressure from either their own family or that of the spouse in order to test their reproductive ability before the wedding day. This is done for fear that one party may not be able to reproduce or have a child after marriage. </p>
						<p class="article">Genuine as this excuse may sound, it is not even enough excuse to lose your virginity. If the other party is so emphatic about this, then it is obvious that what he wants is a child, not you. If there is genuine love between the two parties, child or no child, the love you both share will be untainted. </p>
						<p class="article">Do not allow yourself to be bought over by this excuse. There are people who were pregnant before marriage but lost it immediately after, and have not gotten another since then. There are numerous others who trusted God and kept their purity until marriage and God honoured their faith. </p>
						<p class="article">If you trust God, who alone can enable pregnancy and see it through to delivery time, you will do things the way He desires them to be done. If you decide to neglect God and do it your own way today in order to please some family members, remember someday, you will still need Him at the end of the journey. </p>
