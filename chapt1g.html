	<h3>IT IS OLD SCHOOL</h3>
						<p class="article">Another reason which immoral teenagers and youths give to deceive their more sane fellows into losing their virginity is that virginity is no longer fashionable. They claim it used to be fashionable in the olden days, but that now, no one gives a damn. </p>
						<p class="article">This is far from the truth. Virginity is still as fashionable as it has always been. It has not and will not lose its dignity. People still gives lots of respect to young boys and girls who still protect their God-given sexuality. Even those who have lost theirs still respect them a lot, although they will not admit it publicly. </p>
						<p class="article">See it in this light: whatever is morally right can never become unfashionable. It used to be morally right not to steal in the olden days; it is still morally right today. It used to be morally right not to tell lies in the olden days; it is still morally right today. It used to be morally right to live a chaste life in the olden days; it is still morally right today. </p>
						<p class="article">Do not believe the lies you hear. Protecting your virginity is not “old school”. Just as bathing cannot clean the spots on a leopard's skin, so also today’s modernization cannot re-label what was morally good in the yesteryears.
						<p class="article">Male or female, virginity is still very relevant in our age and time, just as it used to be generations before.  No matter how corrupt and immoral the society may grow, there will never be a time when it no longer will be fashionable. </p>
