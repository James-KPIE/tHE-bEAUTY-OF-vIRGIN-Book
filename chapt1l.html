	<h3>FEAR OF HEALTH COMPLICATION</h3>
						<p class="article">It is also commonly broadcasted in some quarters that when a lady does not lose her virginity or break her hymen early in life, it increases her chances of encountering some health challenges later in life. Some people say it exposes her to fibroid and some others claim that it makes child delivery difficult, while some others say it affects her cycle of menstruation and makes it a painful experience. </p>
						<p class="article">There is no truth in any of these. Keeping your virginity does not make you susceptible to diseases. Fibroid has no relationship with how early or late you start sexual activity. All of these are myths told by sex-hungry men just to make you bow to their sexual demands. In fact, the opposite is true; there are no health advantages to being sexually active early in life. Early engagement in sexual activity can expose you to many health problems. </p>
						<p class="article">All these fabrications are just fables that cannot be proven both medically and scientifically. They are lies to make some people lose their virginity. You do not experience any negative health complication as a result of the preservation of your virginity. On the other hand, it is those who lose theirs early in life that are likely to face some health complications. These health complications are discussed in a later chapter. </p>
						<p class="article">So, whenever someone around you mentions any of these health challenges that they acclaim either masculine or feminine virgins go through, it will just be obvious to you how ignorant such a person is. </p>
